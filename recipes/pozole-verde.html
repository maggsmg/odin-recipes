    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs Pork Shoulder</li>
        <li>2 lbs Chicken Thigh or Breast</li>
        <li>20-30 Green Tomatillos</li>
        <li>1 Chile Serrano</li>
        <li>1 Bunch of Cilantro</li>
        <li>3 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>1 Large Can of White Hominy</li>
        <li>Chopped Lettuce (optional)</li>
        <li>Diced Radish (optional)</li>
        <li>Diced Cucumber (optional)</li>
        <li>3 Limes</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the pork shoulder into medium sized pieces. This helps it cook faster</li>
        <li>Boil the pork and chicken. The pork takes longer to cook through than the chicken so it’s best to add it first. Also, throw the garlic cloves and salt into the water to cook along with the meat.</li>
        <li>Prep the tomatillos and chile. Simply take the leafy cover off the tomatillos. Cut the chile in half and remove the seeds with a fork. Careful around the eyes!</li>
        <li>While the meat boils, add the tomatillos and chile to a separate pot of boiling water.  Cook these until the color changes from bright green to a paler olive shade. Very important that these are not overdone.</li>
        <li>Blend the veggies to make the green sauce. Throw the tomatillos and chile into a blender along with the cilantro and some of the stock from boiling the meat.</li>
        <li>Cook the green sauce. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to a saucepan and dump the blended sauce in. Bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Pull apart the meat. After the meat is thoroughly cooked, remove from the pot and pull apart with 2 forks. Also a good time to fish out the garlic cloves from the pot.</li>
        <li>Combine everything! Add the meat, green sauce, and can of hominy back in to the main pot and you have Pozole Verde! Let this sit on simmer for another 10 minutes or so to combine everything.</li>
        <li>Add finishing touches. At this point, any of the optional ingredients can be added to bowls of the soup. At a minimum, each bowl should get the squeeze of a lime!</li>
    </ol>
