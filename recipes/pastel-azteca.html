    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pastel Azteca is a traditional Mexican dish made with layers of tortillas, shredded chicken, tomato or chile sauce, cream, cheese, and vegetables like corn and poblano pepper strips.
        <br> It's similar to a Mexican lasagna, with a creamy, mildly spicy flavor. It's baked until the cheese melts and is served hot.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb Chicken Thigh or Breast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>4-6 Poblano Peppers</li>
        <li>1 Can of corn</li>
        <li>1 pk of Corn Tortillas</li>
        <li>1 bottle of Mexican Cream</li>
        <li>8 oz Oaxaca/Mozzarella Cheese</li>
        <li>4 Roma Tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 White Onion</li>
        <li>2 Garlic Cloves</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Knorr Pollo (Chicken Bouillon)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the chicken with italian seasoning, the bay leaves, one of the garlic cloves, and 1/4 of the white onion.</li>
        <li>Roast the poblano peppers until the skin is burnt and set the aside in a plastic bag to let the skin come lose.Peel the peppers, cut them open and remove the seeds with a fork, cut them in julienne strips. Careful around the eyes!</li>
        <li>For the salsa: roast the tomatoes, onion and garlic with a little olive oil in a pan. Once their soft and all the way cooked throw them into a blender along with the knorr pollo.</li>
        <li>Cook the salsa. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to a saucepan and dump the blended sauce in. Bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven. This is probably a good time to preheat the oven at 350 degrees</li>
        <li>Pull apart the chicken. After the meat is thoroughly cooked, remove from the pot and pull apart with 2 forks. Also a good time to fish out the garlic cloves from the pot.</li>
        <li>Build your mexican lasagna! Cut your tortillas so they cover the whole container area and arrange the first layer. Add the chicken, peppers, corn, salsa, cheese and cream in that order and repeat for each layer.</li>
        <li>Make sure the last layer has only cheese on top so it creates a crust once in the oven.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with aluminium and throw it in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes or until the cheese melts.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Tips and tricks</h4>
    <p>Prepping the peppers a day before helps a lot! Once ready throw them in the fridge and they'll be ready for when you build the dish.‚Äù</p>
